With the Frame and the PCB you can plug in any 3.7V LiPo with a PH2.0 that will fit. The largest battery I found that can fit is a 503048, this turned out to be a 800mAh, the original was 740 mAh. To assemble this glue the PCB into the frame, insert the battery and then wrap with Kapton tape to keep everything in place.
